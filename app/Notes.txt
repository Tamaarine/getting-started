Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is just a text based script that instructs Docker how to make a container image

Directives

1. CMD is the default command to run when starting a container from an image

2. -t flag when running docker build gives output image a human readbable name 

3. -d flag tells docker to run the new container in "Detached" mode means run it in the background 

4. -p flag tells docker to create a mapping from hostPort:containerPort, without it container's port wouldn't be accessible




Useful Commands

docker system prune -a -> For cleaning up container, networks, images, build caches

docker volumes prune -> Clean up unused volumes

Named volume are great if we want to store data

Bind mounts are used to persist data, but more often it is used as a shared folder kind of mechanics

like nodemon in node.js
